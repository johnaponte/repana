## Introduction

Repana is an opinionated framework. It means that the structure of the project
must be defined so the project knows where to save different type of files.
The structure of Repana is defined by the `config.yml' file. The function 
`repana::make_structure()` helps to construct the directory structure. If there
is no `config.yml', `make_structure()` provide one to you.


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(repana)
```
