Each program run initiated by the `master()` command generates an output that is
automatically saved in the `logs` directory. By default, the output is in 
`HTML` format.

However, users have the flexibility to create additional reports within each 
program using the `render_report()` function. By default, documents generated by
this function are stored in the `reports` directory.

For more detailed information on using the `render_report()` 
function, you can refer to the documentation by executing the following command:
`help(render_report)`
